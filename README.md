# Discord Bot

+ Discord API: [bwmarrin/discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
+ MongoDB Drivers: [go-mgo/mgo](https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo)
+ Current: [d0x1p2/SchiNET](https://github.com/d0x1p2/SchiNET)

This is the second iteration of my Go based Discord bot. First attempt, although successful, quickly snowballed into a much larger project than expected.

After learning a fair bit about Go and using the Discord API bindings, I am making my second attempt at cleaner and more efficient practices by splitting up the code base into more appropriate packages.

The original can still be seen at the link above.
