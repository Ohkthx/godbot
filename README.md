### Discord Bot
+ Discord API: [bwmarrin/discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
+ MySQL Drivers: [my-sql-driver/mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
+ Vita-Nex: Core API [d0x1p2/vncgo](https://github.com/d0x1p2/vncgo)

This is the second iteration of my Go based Discord bot. First attempt, although successful, quickly snowballed into a much larger project than expected.

After learning a fair bit about Go and using the Discord API bindings, I am making my second attempt at cleaner and more efficient practices.

The original can still be seen at [d0x1p2/DiscordBot-go](https://github.com/d0x1p2/DiscordBot-go)
