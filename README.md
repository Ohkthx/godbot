This is the second iteration of my Go based Discord bot. First attempt, although successful, quickly snowballed into a much larger project than expected.

After learning a fair bit about Go and using the Discord API bindings, I am making my second attempt at cleaner and more efficient practices by splitting up the code base into more appropriate packages.

The original can still be seen at the link above.
